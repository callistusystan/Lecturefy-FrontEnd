# Lecturefy

This project won <strong>FIRST PLACE</strong> for the Engage Category in the recent Monash Hackamon 2017.


The concept is an interactive platform for lecturers to present their powerpoint slides, with special addons/plugins that we call "Boosters". The feature that stands out the most for this platform is that anyone can create boosters for this platform, and there are endless possibilities.


We spoke to many people with amazing booster ideas, which we would like to highlight:- 
1. A REPL that allows coders to solve coding challenges with the same environment variables as the lecturer. Instead of only believing the lecturer when he/she explains the outcome of some particular coding error, students can modify and run the code to see the outcomes for themselves.
2. Another awesome booster idea is a quiz for medical students. The students will be presented an image of a human organ, and the challenge for them would be to click on the area which they believe is infected. The presenter will be able to see the distribution of student clicks in real-time, which gives helpful insight on the overall student progress.


This project was made by Team Pineapple Bae with React, Chart.js, Node.js, Express and Socket.io.
